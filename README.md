Slides that are used as an introduction and guideline during every AmsterdamPHP
meetup. The slides are created in HTML, Javascript and CSS to allow everybody
to use these slides on whatever device they want, instead of the old
keynote-based slides.

# Creating a slidedeck for the next meetup

A couple of steps are required to create the best slidedeck for the next meetup.
Next to these steps, you are free to add, update or remove slides according to
the needs of the meetup.

First things first though:
1. Change the date and logo of the hoster on the first slide
2. Change the larger logo of the hoster on the second slide
3. Optional: change the slides of the prizes we're going to raffle
4. Change the name and the picture of the speaker
5. Change the joind.in url for after the talk
6. Optional: change the slides of the upcoming conferences
7. Change the date and the logo of the hoster of the next meetup on the last
slide
